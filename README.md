# InsiderBackendStudy

League Simulation API Project for Insider's internship program.

# Using Public Server
You can try the API without setting up an environment yourself.

The server will be up from 25/05/2025 to 24/06/2025, and is running on a Compute Engine VM Instance of Google Cloud.

Port: `8080`

Refer to the endpoints for testing, and use the given public IP as the hostname instead of localhost.

# Setting Up
1- Prepare the .env file according to the given .env.example

2- Run main.go

3- Refer to the hostname accordingly.

## Error Handling & Notes

* **500 Internal Server Error** on unexpected failures (database or logic).
* **Idempotent operations:**

  * `/reset` always returns to the initial state.
  * `/simulate_tournament` has no effect once complete.

Ensure the `"server"` remains running to preserve state between calls.
